# Sorting Algorithms Analysis with Google Colab

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the performance of various sorting algorithms using Google Colab. By visualizing the time complexity and behavior of these algorithms through graphs, we can better understand their efficiency in different scenarios (best case and worst case).

## Sorting Algorithms Covered
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**

## Analysis Objectives
1. **Understand Time Complexity**: Evaluate the time complexity (O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), etc.) for each sorting algorithm.
2. **Best Case Analysis**: Determine the performance of each algorithm when the input data is already sorted.
3. **Worst Case Analysis**: Determine the performance when the input data is in the worst possible order for each algorithm.

## Methodology
- **Implementation**: Each sorting algorithm is implemented in Python within a Google Colab notebook.
- **Data Generation**: Random and specifically ordered datasets are generated to simulate best and worst-case scenarios.
- **Performance Measurement**: The execution time of each algorithm is recorded and plotted using graphs for comparative analysis.

## Findings
### Bubble Sort
- **Best Case**: O(n) - Efficient when data is nearly sorted.
- **Worst Case**: O(n^2) - Performance degrades significantly with larger datasets.

### Insertion Sort
- **Best Case**: O(n) - Performs well with nearly sorted data.
- **Worst Case**: O(n^2) - Slow with large, unsorted datasets.

### Selection Sort
- **Best Case**: O(n^2) - Performance is consistent regardless of data order.
- **Worst Case**: O(n^2) - Not suitable for large datasets.

### Merge Sort
- **Best Case**: O(n log n) - Consistently efficient.
- **Worst Case**: O(n log n) - Maintains performance even with large, unsorted data.

### Quick Sort
- **Best Case**: O(n log n) - Very efficient with good pivot selection.
- **Worst Case**: O(n^2) - Poor performance with bad pivot selection, e.g., already sorted data.

### Heap Sort
- **Best Case**: O(n log n) - Consistent performance.
- **Worst Case**: O(n log n) - Handles large datasets well.

## Conclusion
The project provides a comprehensive analysis of sorting algorithms, highlighting that:
- **Merge Sort** and **Heap Sort** offer consistently good performance in both best and worst-case scenarios.
- **Quick Sort** is highly efficient on average but can degrade with poor pivot choices.
- **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, and **Selection Sort** are less efficient with larger datasets, particularly in worst-case scenarios.

The visual graphs generated in the notebook facilitate a clear comparison of the algorithms' performances, making it easier to choose the right sorting technique based on the specific requirements of the data being processed.
